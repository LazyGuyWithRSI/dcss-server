dgamelaunch-config
------------------

This is a collection of scripts to manage a dgamelaunch
(http://www.advogato.org/proj/dgamelaunch/) install, all run from an
umbrella `dgl` script.

These are still very incomplete, WIP.

Currently available commands:

1. Update your dgamelaunch config from the repository:
   $ sudo dgl publish --confirm

2. Change a dgl user's password:
   $ sudo dgl passwd johndoe

3. Update Crawl alpha build from git master:
   $ dgl update-trunk

4. Remove stale Crawl alpha versions:
   $ dgl remove-trunks

Note: Some of these commands will probably change names soon.

The ultimate goal for this project is to become a one-stop shop for
all your dgamelaunch+Crawl needs, starting from installing dgamelaunch
itself

TODO
----

1. `dgl install-dgl` command to fetch and install the latest dgamelaunch.

2. `dgl create-chroot` command to set up a basic chroot jail with all the
   fixtures dgamelaunch wants (dgamelaunch already has a skeleton script
   that can serve as a basis, although this is unfortunately NetHack-biased).
   
3. Support for installing different games, including fetching their sources
   from their respective source repositories, compiling, installing into the
   chroot, etc.
       `dgl install crawl master`,
       `dgl install nethack 3.4.3` etc.)

   Installing a game should also (eventually) add a suitable entry to
   the various menu files and update the dgamelaunch config
   appropriately.

4. Support for tracking development versions of games (such as Crawl
   master) using a system similar to CDO's for creating versioned
   directories, migrating saves to newer versions, and deleting old
   versions with no remaining save games.
